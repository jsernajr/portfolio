# Java Portfolio Projects

This directory contains several Java projects demonstrating core programming concepts and best practices.

## Projects Overview

### 1. NavyDBTracker
Simulates a Navy database tracking system that monitors false alarms across multiple bases with uptime metrics.
- **Key Concepts**: Arrays, loops, data aggregation
- **Run**: `java NavyDBTracker`

### 2. PatchManager
Manages server patching across a fleet of systems, tracking patch deployment status and incident reduction metrics.
- **Key Concepts**: Boolean arrays, conditional logic, statistics
- **Run**: `java PatchManager`

### 3. ACASScanner
ACAS (Automated Computer and Assessment Security) scanner that identifies vulnerabilities across virtual machines.
- **Key Concepts**: Arrays, loops, data analysis
- **Run**: `java ACASScanner`

### 4. WeatherAnalyzer
Processes and analyzes weather data including temperature, humidity, and wind speed statistics.
- **Files**: `WeatherData.java`, `WeatherAnalyzer.java`
- **Key Concepts**: 
  - Object-oriented design
  - ArrayList for dynamic storage
  - Statistical calculations (average, min, max)
  - Data analysis and reporting
- **Features**:
  - Add weather data points
  - Calculate average/max/min temperatures
  - Track humidity and wind speed
  - Generate detailed weather reports
- **Run**: `java WeatherAnalyzer`

### 5. LibraryManagementSystem
A complete library system for cataloging books, managing checkouts/returns, and tracking availability.
- **Files**: `Book.java`, `LibraryManagementSystem.java`
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Object-oriented design
  - ArrayList for dynamic collections
  - Search and filter functionality
  - State management (availability tracking)
  - Statistics and reporting
- **Features**:
  - Add books to catalog
  - Check out and return books

  - Availability rate calculations
- **Run**: `java LibraryManagementSystem`

## Running All Projects

### Linux/Mac:
```bash
./run-all.sh
```

### Windows:
```batch
run-all.bat
```

## Code Structure

Each project demonstrates:
- **Clean Code**: Well-organized, readable code with meaningful names
- **Encapsulation**: Private fields with public getters/setters
- **Documentation**: Comments and JavaDoc-style documentation
- **Best Practices**: Proper exception handling and input validation
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Classes, inheritance, and composition patterns
